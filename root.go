you only remember its name, but not its full path? 
For example: you want to import the gin package, 
but you don't remember the full path to import the package (github.com/gin-gonic/gin). 
Now you can use this tool to get the package you want more easily by typing a simple statement: [get gin]. 
It's that simple!`,

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
